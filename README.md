[Caribbean Kidz](https://caribbean-kidz.web.app/) is an NGO (Not-for Profit Organization) based in El Yaque, Margarita. It is dedicated to offering educational programs to children at no cost. The programs cover the following subjects:Â 

- Primary & lower secondary education
- Environmental education
- Sports


The website 
https://caribbean-kidz.web.app/ is a donation that I have made to the Caribbean Kidz team to help them increase awareness in Margarita and the world, and to improve their online presence for fund-raising.
